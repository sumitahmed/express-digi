Express is a simple library which makes yuur life a lil bit easier to go ahead and write routes for it...like /insta, /x etc, whenevr you want to take the user on your websites and what the response we need to send, thats where Exress helps us a lil bit...

all that we write for authentication logic, authorization logic, all the business logic, what happens with the data, is the data valid.
should i give a response back, should i not give a response back.
